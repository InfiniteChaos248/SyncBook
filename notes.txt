admin APIs - create booking (movie name, movie id (to show in URL), movie theatre, date, time, screen, seats), enable/disable booking

login/integrate with Google Forms/generate unique access ID for each person

{{url}}/boy-and-heron will open booking page showing movie info and listing seats - white = available, green = selected, gray = bloked/booked
can select only 1 seat or multiple? - to select multiple, need to add access ID to select additional seat (1 access ID per seat)

payment gateway integration? or include API for Nazo to approve payment screenshot

concurrent access:
user selects seats -> API call to check and block seat [seat already booked so can't block, seat available so block, seat blocked so need to wait and refresh for unblock or book]
user deselects seats -> API call to check and unblock seat [can only unblock if seat is blocked by self]
user book seats -> API call to book seats [can only book if seat is blocked by self]

on block/unblock how does another user who is seeing the same screen know? polling or socket session or lazy read (API call when user selects seat and update UI then)
use polling (sync data every 30s or 1m) and also lazy read (sync when block/unblock/book/refresh API is called)
